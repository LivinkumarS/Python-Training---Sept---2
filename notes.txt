Python
-------
>> It is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language.
>> known for its simplicity and readability

human written code ---> machine code.
interpreted ---> line by line code execution.

compilation ---> each and every line will be converted into machine code in one go. the executed
interpreted ---> code will be converted and executed line by line.

Extension --> .py
to execute python file ---> python filename.

First code 
------------
print(data)  --> printing something at the output.

Variables
----------
>> a name that stores a value in a memory.
varName=data

Rules of naming:
----------------
>> start with a letter or an underscore
>> no spaces and no special char.
>> case-sensitive.

Basic syntax:
---------------
1) Indentation--> space before a block of code.
2) Case-sensitive. uppercase and lowercase are treated as different things. (a=A)
3) Comments ---> increases readability.
   single line comment---> # 
   multiline comments ---> ''' comments '''



Datatypes
---------
integer --> whole numbers --> -2,-1,0,1,2,3,33,400...
float --> decimal numbers --> -2.22,9.99....2.0

string --> Sequence of char wrapped with either '' or "".
concatination --> '+' used to attach 2 strings together.
formatted string--> f""

boolean --> True or False 


Type Casting
------------
>> Converting a datatype to another.
type(obj) --> find out the datatype of given object. <class int>

int() --> convert anything into integer. int('123')--> 123
str()  --> into string
float() --> into float
